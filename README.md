# sudoku-solver-app

## Overview
This Sudoku Solver app is an innovative iPhone application that uses advanced image recognition and solving algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles. Users can simply take a picture of a Sudoku puzzle, and the app will display the solved puzzle. The app leverages a Python backend with OpenCV and PyTorch for image processing and puzzle solving, and a Swift-based frontend for a seamless user experience.

## Features
- **Image Recognition**: Employs a robust CNN algorithm to recognize the puzzle digits.
- **Image Handling**: Utilizes OpenCV for image handling
- **Puzzle Solving**: A robust recursive programming technique is used to solve the puzzle.
- **Intuitive Interface**: A user-friendly Swift-based frontend for easy interaction with the app.
